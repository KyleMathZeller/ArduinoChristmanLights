# Christmas Light Arch-Light Controller

This is a simple project that will be mixture of coding, crafting, electronics, and Christmas Cheer.

In Lewiston, ID. They have a Christmas light set up every year with a variety of displays. One of the ones my sister and myself particularlly enjoy is more simple metal arches wrapped in christmas lights that cross the paths that change color as you walk through them. Unfortunately when my sister contacted an employee of the city to inquire where they aquired the devices they told her that, the product was no longer made.

So being pragmatic she decided to just make them herself. Upon hearing about this project from her, I was entruiged and offered to aquire hardware, do some testing and coding, while she would be incharge of LED and their drivers, and the size of the arches. 


## End Project Goals
- Code to run on an Arduino Uno (It's what we already had you can use anything)
- 3-D printable housing for the Arduino Uno and Ultrasonic Sensor
- Wiring diagrams for the components and how to hook it all together
- Lists of all the components used
Bonus items
- I will try to include videos and pictures as we work through the project.
